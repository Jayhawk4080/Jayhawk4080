- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jayhawk4080
- 👀 I’m interested in audio sciences, Free and Open Source Software, and developing CLI programs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced bash scripts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, because I work alone. Usually.
- 📫 How to reach me: Contact me on Discord at `Jayツ#0001`. I am always available to messages. Friend requests from people I don't know are ignored, so message me first (join a community I'm in, like the Arch Linux community: https://discord.gg/tjERsv9JGy)
